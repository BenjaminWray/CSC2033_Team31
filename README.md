## Background
The UN Sustainability Goal Number Nine: Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation, and foster innovation. <br>

To help further this goal we've created a python web application which aims to help educate and raise people's awareness of these goals through the use of flashcards to allow people to revise and quizzes to help people test their knowledge. <br>

Users will be able to take quizzes and study using the flashcards regardless of whether they have an account, and then logged-in users will be able to see their quiz history as well as place on a leaderboard. <br>

## Features:
- Account Creation and Login.
- Admins can create, edit, and delete flashcards.
- Users can take quizzes.
- Users with accounts can save quiz results and place on a leaderboard.
- When registering for an account users will be able to input their location for flashcards specific to them.
