## Background
The **UN Sustainability Goal Number Nine** aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation, and foster innovation. <br>

To help further this goal we've created a python web application which aims to help educate and raise people's awareness of these goals through the use of flashcards to allow people to revise and quizzes to help people test their knowledge. <br>

Users will be able to take quizzes and study using the flashcards regardless of whether they have an account, and then logged-in users will be able to see their quiz history as well as place on a leaderboard. <br>

Admins will create and maintain the flashcards questions for the quizzes ensuring that the information is up-to-date with the Sustainability Goal.

## Features:
- Account Creation and Login.
